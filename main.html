  const subject_embassies = "[Urgent] [Time Sensitive] Call for Accountability Regarding Constitutional Rights Violations During GenZ212 Protests";

  const body_embassies = `Dear Ambassador,%0A%0A
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you as a concerned member of the Moroccan diaspora to express my deep distress regarding the images of apparent rights violations and police brutality that occurred during the recent GenZ212 peaceful protests in Morocco. The GenZ212 peaceful protests demand better healthcare and education systems, and immediate investigation and accountability of the widespread corruption allegations — all of which are demands I second. As someone who cares about my country's prosperity and the wellbeing of its citizens, I feel compelled to address these grave concerns with your esteemed office.%0A%0A
It has come to my attention that, during the peaceful protests that began on September 27th, many peaceful demonstrators were subjected to excessive force, arbitrary arrests, and physical harm by law enforcement across multiple cities. The actions of the police — including beatings, wounding, and detention of peaceful protestors (some of whom are minors) without due process — are in violation of both domestic Moroccan law (Articles 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 32 of the Moroccan constitution) and international conventions (including the ICCPR, ICESCR, and CAT) which Morocco has ratified.%0A%0A
I urge the Moroccan government and the embassy to take immediate action:%0A
* Conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into the corruption allegations, as well as the actions of law enforcement during the peaceful protests.%0A
* Immediately release individuals who have been detained without charge and due process, following these peaceful protests.%0A
* Commit to addressing the systemic issues that are at the heart of these peaceful protests.%0A%0A
As a member of the global Moroccan diaspora, I express my full support for the brave individuals who continue to stand and speak up for a better, more just Morocco. It is imperative that the government upholds the dignity and rights of its citizens, especially the youth who represent the future of the nation.%0A%0A
I kindly request a response outlining what actions the embassy intends to take to address these concerns. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.%0A%0ABest regards,%0A[Sender's Full Name]`;
